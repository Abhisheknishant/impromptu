  # A note on updating bash scripts:
  #
  # Shells interpret a file as it executes. As a result, if you overwrite a script while it is
  # executing, the script will then continue execution within the new file. This quickly leads to
  # unpredictable behavior which could cause a painful update process (to say the least).
  #
  # However, we can instruct the shell to read the entirety of a file by placing its contents inside
  # of a code block and terminating the block with an exit keyword (in case the new file has any
  # additional lines).
